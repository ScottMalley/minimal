When I took computational physics I was always excited at the gratification I got from spending hours on a piece of code, and then finally running it to see a beautiful image that represented some kind of physical equaiton. The more I think about it though, the more I realize that maybe the physical equation is not necessary. In a sense I love physics because of the inherent beauty that stems from the fact that we as thinking beings can attempt to understand fundamental truths about our surroundings. However, when thinking about beauty, maybe it is just as fantastic that we as physical, rational beings can construct something that is meaningless to our surroundings: something that has nothing to do with nature, something that comes only from within us.
